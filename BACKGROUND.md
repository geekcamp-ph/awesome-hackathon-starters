**What is a "hackathon starter"?**

It is a template usually for a framework or DSL meant to help you get started quickly (questionable) to **create** an application.
A starter template should at least help you easily deploy on Heroku, Amazon EC2, OpenShift, etc.
Use these if you want to. Sometimes it is best to study and probably work on your own template.
